# ðŸš— Automated License Plate Recognition

ALPR â€” This is a project that will automatically identify the license number of a car arriving at a parking barrier and check whether a vehicle with this license plate is allowed to enter its database. If the car has the right to cross the parking barrier in this case the barrier will be opened automatically


> The idea of the project came to three people in 2022 who are participating in the Hardware Startup Incubator. As part of the project, participants are required to create a project where [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) will be used.
